## About this workshop

:interrobang:  Feel free to interrupt me with questions or comments at any time!
:clock5: If time allows, I'll end before 17h00 and stay until 17h30 or earlier to chat/help
:speech_balloon: I'll _try_ to keep an eye out for reactions/messages. Better use your voice!
:computer: If you haven't installed Make on your computer yet, please do so now!
:spiral_notepad: If you can't/won't write, stick around anyway: you might still learn something :grin:

# Is this workshop for me?

So this is the problem we're trying to solve with Make:

- While doing research, your file structure may look like this:

```bash
├── data
│   └── dataset1.csv
│   └── dataset2.xls
├── code
│   ├── analysis.R
│   └── simulation.py
└── tex
    ├── paper.tex
    ├── poster.tex
    └── references.bib
```
* These files will often be shared (co-authors, peers, reviewers, general public)
* There's usually a **logical sequence of events** in there (read, treat, simulate, analyse, present), but this is often not obvious to anyone but yourself.

# What is Make?

## Make
* A tool to control the creation of files on your computer
* Centered around the execution of a script file (named "Makefile")
* _Often_ used by software developers to facilitate the compilation of programs (but...)

## GNU Make
* The standard implementation of Make for Linux and macOS
* One of about a dozen derivatives of Make ([according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Derivatives))

---

# What is a Makefile?

* A file literally called `Makefile`. No extension necessary.
* A collection of _recipes_ for:
	- Generating files
	- Specifying a dependency (input-output) relationship between files

---

# Why would a scientist care about Makefiles?

* Make automates the work of scientists, which often involves handling several files of different formats in a certain order
	1. Data files
	2. Data treatment scripts
	3. Analysis scripts
	4. Manuscript/presentation files (Word, PowerPoint)
	5. Manuscript/presentation scripts (LaTeX, Markdown, reStructuredText)
* Think of a Makefile as a "meta-script", or a "cookbook" containing "recipes" for executing and creating your research files
* Make is smart: it executes a recipe if and only if its "parents" change
* Make is code-agnostic (though it assumes you know basic terminal commands)

---

# Installing Make

- <img src="aux/linux.png" height=20> use your distribution's package manager (apt, dnf, yum, pacman...)
- <img src="aux/apple.png" height=20> use your app store or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
-  <img src="aux/windows.png" height=20> download [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) or use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/make)

---

## Windows caveats

Make was built for Unix-like systems, so making it work on Windows might feel a bit hacky (like R, which needs to).

## Mac caveats

You might not be able to run make if your default shell is zsh instead of bash. Here's a solution (thanks to [Vandana](https://github.com/orgs/ocbe-uio/people/VandanaRav)):

1. Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or follow [this page](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-homebrew-on-macos)
2. Run [`brew install make`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make)

---

3. If you get an error like
```bash
==> Searching for similarly named formulae...
Error: No similarly named formulae found.
Error: No available formula or cask with the name "make".
==> Searching for a previously deleted formula (in the last month)...
Error: No previously deleted formula found.
==> Searching taps on GitHub...
Error: No formulae found in taps.
```
Run brew doctor to check for any warnings. If you have any, verify the warnings and debug them. Once this is done rerun `brew install make`

---

Once you get this message, you're good to go:
```bash
==> Caveats
GNU "make" has been installed as "gmake".

If you need to use it as "make", you can add a "gnubin" directory
to your PATH from your bashrc like:
	PATH="/usr/local/opt/make/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
==> Summary
🍺 /usr/local/Cellar/make/4.3: 15 files, 1MB
```

To uninstall homebrew check out [this page](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#how-do-i-uninstall-homebrew).

---


# Check if your installation is OK

1. Open a Terminal
2. Run `make --version` and see if there's any output (may be `gmake` on Mac)

---

# Basic elements of a Makefile

## `Makefile` file content

```Makefile
target_file_1: dependency_file_1
	command_1_to_create target_file_1 --using dependency_file_1
	command_2_to_create target_file_1 --using dependency_file_1

target_file_2: dependency_file_2 dependency_file_3
	command_1_to_create target_file_2 --using dependency_file_2 dependency_file_3
```

P.S.: _always_ indent with tabs!

## Using Make on terminal

```bash
make
make target_file_2    # specifically creates target_file_2 (if its dependencies changed)
make target_file_2 -B # creates target_file_2 no matter what
```

# A simple Makefile for your research

Suppose this is your project's working directory:

```bash
[me@computer] tree
.
├── data
│   └── data_original.csv
├── inters
│   ├── data_analysis.R
│   ├── manus.tex
│   ├── presentation.Rmd
│   ├── references.bib
│   ├── run_simulation.R
│   └── treat_data.R
└── output

3 directories, 7 files
```

<!-- Fairly organized, but hard to understand the order of things! -->

---

Here's how your workflow could look on Make:

```Makefile
all: data/data_treated.rda output/analysis_out.rda output/presentation.pdf

# Handling datasets
data/data_treated.rda: data/data_original.csv
	Rscript inters/treat_data.R

# Doing research
output/sim_out.txt: data/data_treated.rda inters/run_simulation.R
	R --no-save <inters/run_simulation.R >output/sim_out.txt
output/analysis_out.rda: data/data_treated.rda output/sim_out.txt
	Rscript inters/data_analysis.R

# Generating documents
publish: output/presentation.pdf output/manus.pdf
output/presentation.pdf: inters/presentation.Rmd output/sim_out.txt output/analysis_out.rda
	R -e "rmarkdown::render(input='inters/presentation.Rmd', output_dir='output')"
output/manus.pdf: inters/manus.tex inters/references.bib
	latexmk -pdf inters/manus.tex
	mv manus.pdf output/ # this could also be done inside latexmk
	rm manus.*
	firefox http://mail.uio.no # to send an e-mail to collaborators

clean:
	rm data/data_treated.rda output/*
```

---

# Time to put the "work" in this workshop.<br>Let's recreate this file!

---

# Using variables

Remember the **DRY** principle: **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself!

```Makefile
out/results: in/script3 in/script1 in/script2
	command1 --option1 --option2 out/results
	command2 --option1 --option2 --option3 --option4 out/results
```

Try this instead:

```Makefile
OUT_DIR=out
IN_DIR=in
COMMON_OPTS=--option1 --option2

$(OUT_DIR)/results: $(IN_DIR)/script3 $(IN_DIR)/script1 $(IN_DIR)/script2
	command1 $(COMMON_OPTS) -o $(OUT_DIR)/results -i $(IN_DIR)/script1 $(IN_DIR)/script2
	command2 $(COMMON_OPTS) --option3 --option4 -o $(OUT_DIR)/results -i $(IN_DIR)/script3
```

Looks more verbose, but maintenance and expandability is improved!

Notice how `script3` came first? You'll soon see why.

---

## Automatic variables

- `$@` Target
- `$^` All the target's dependencies
- `$<` Target's first dependency

Good luck memorizing these (which is not even [all of them](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html))! :grimacing:

```Makefile
OUT_DIR=out
IN_DIR=in
OPTS=--options

$(OUT_DIR)/results: $(IN_DIR)/script3 $(IN_DIR)/script1 $(IN_DIR)/script2
	command1 $(COMMON_OPTS) -o $@ -i $^
	command2 $(COMMON_OPTS) --option3 --option4 -o $@ -i $<
```

Barely readable, but such is the Make life (workaround: `$(word 3, $^)`).

---

# Putting on some lipstick

```Makefile
# You can add comments like this!
target: dep1 dep2
	echo "This command will also be printed" # prints command and output
	touch file.txt                           # prints command and output
	@echo -e "\nFiles present:"              # only prints output
	@tree
clean: # This is called a phony target because it's not really a file
	@echo "Removing file.txt"
	@rm file.txt
	@tree
```

---

### Output of `make`

```bash
echo "This command will also be printed"
This command will also be printed
Only the output will be printed here
touch file.txt

Files present:
.
├── file.txt
└── Makefile

0 directories, 2 files
```

### Output of `make clean`

```bash
Removing file.txt
rm file.txt
.
└── Makefile

0 directories, 1 file
```


---

# Summary

- Make is not just for compiling software: it's a great project management tool!
- Have a Makefile in your research folder to:
  - Concentrate all recipes for creating files that depend on other files
  - Make your workflow clearer to to others (and your future self)

---

# Q&A
1. When's the next WERC?
	:shrug:
2. What will it be about?
	Either R web apps (Shiny and crosstalk) or remote computing (OCBE/UiO servers)
3. What about future workshops?
	Topics will probably follow the popularity order from [this nettskjema](https://nettskjema.no/published/156018.html?chart=1).

# Final slide! :partying_face:

- Thanks for coming!
- Class dismissed! You may now go in peace. Go and make... Makefiles.
- I'll be staying here for a little longer in case you wanna talk)
