# Introduction

This is a repository for open slides presented to the public. It is not to be confused with the private repository hosted on our [UiO Enterprise GitHub page](https://github.uio.no/ocbe/meeting-notes-and-slides), designed to host presentations containing private or sensitive information.

By "open slides", we mean licensed by CC-BY-SA-4.0. You can read more about it on the [License](#license) section below.

# File structure

## The `Presented` folder

This folder contains the slides as they were seen by the public (or an updated version of them). **The files should be in a universal, unwritable format** such as .pdf or .html.

## The `Source` folder

This folder contains files used to generate the presented slides. **These files can be in whatever format you prefer**, but are usually formatted as .tex, .md, .Rmd, .html or .pptx.

This folder contains an `Images` subfolder which you can use to upload the figures used in the source code, if you wish.

# File naming convention

Please prepend your files with the presentation date in the format `YYYYMMDD-` so they are properly sorted and more easily findable.
