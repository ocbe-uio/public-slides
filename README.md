# What is this place?

This is a repository for open slides presented to the public. It is not to be confused with the private repository hosted on our [UiO Enterprise GitHub page](https://github.uio.no/ocbe/meeting-notes-and-slides), designed to host presentations containing private or sensitive information not ready for public release. It may, however, host privately-presented slides that can be publicly available as long as they comply with the repository license (read more about it [below](#license)).

# File naming convention

Please prepend your files with the presentation date in the format `YYYYMMDD-` so they are properly sorted and more easily findable.
